# Sales Summary Report

## Project Description
The **Sales Summary Report** is a single-page web application designed to fetch sales data from a CSV file and calculate the total sales amount. This project provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to quickly view the total sales figure. The application is built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5, ensuring a responsive and modern design.

## Features
- Fetches sales data from a CSV file.
- Sums the values in the sales column.
- Displays the total sales amount prominently on the page.
- Uses Bootstrap 5 for a responsive design.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/24f2008913/sum-of-sales-20251017164604.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd sum-of-sales-20251017164604
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the application.

4. **Ensure Internet Connectivity**
   The application loads Bootstrap 5 from jsdelivr, so ensure you have an active internet connection while accessing the app.

## Usage Guide
1. Once the application is open, it will automatically fetch the `data.csv` file from the specified attachments.
2. The application will calculate the total sales by summing the sales column values from the CSV.
3. The total sales amount will be displayed in the designated `#total-sales` element on the page.
4. The title of the page is set to "Sales Summary Report" for clarity.

## Code Explanation
The application consists of the following key components:

- **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains the layout and structure of the web application, including the Bootstrap 5 framework.
  
- **JavaScript Logic**: The script fetches the CSV file, processes the data to extract sales values, and calculates the total. It updates the DOM to display the total sales amount in the `#total-sales` element.

- **Bootstrap 5 Integration**: The application utilizes Bootstrap 5 for styling and responsiveness, imported via jsdelivr.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the main JavaScript logic:

```javascript
fetch('path/to/data.csv')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => {
    const rows = data.split('\n').slice(1);
    let totalSales = 0;
    
    rows.forEach(row => {
      const columns = row.split(',');
      totalSales += parseFloat(columns[salesColumnIndex]); // Replace with actual index
    });
    
    document.getElementById('total-sales').innerText = totalSales;
  });
```
